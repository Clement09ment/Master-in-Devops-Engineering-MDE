Understanding Helix Core server Authorization and Authtication

	Authtication - How you should access the perforce server aka Helix Core server
		1. Active Directory or LDAP 
		2. Helix Server’s internal user database, db.user
		3. Against an authentication server
		
	How can you login?
		server security levels
			PASSWORD OR TICKET OR BOTH
			
			TICKET - 12 HOURS
			HOW TO GET A TICKET?
			$ p4 login -p 
			export P4PASSWD = XXXXXXXX
			
	0 - does not require passwords and does not enforce password strength
	1 - Ensures that all users have passwords
	2 - Ensures that all users have strong passwords
	3 - Requires that all users have strong passwords, and requires the use of ticket-based
	

	
	Authorization - WHo has what access?
			 protections for users and user groups
Step 1 - 	CREATE A GROUP
Step 2 - 	CEATE A USER 
Step 3 - 	MODIFY A PROTECT TABLE

	
How to backup Helix Core server?
Perforce (Helix Core) Repository
	VERSIONED FILES	 --------------> RSYNC
	DATABASE (METADATA)	-----> Checkpointing

db.* --> CHECKPOINT

$ export P4PORT=ssl:1666
$ export P4USER=super
$ p4 login
$ p4 admin stop
$ p4d -r /opt/perforce/servers/master -jc

checkpoint.1 - Created Backup of db.*
checkpoint.1.md5 - verify the file checkpoint.1

IN THIS CASE - ALL THE ENTRY FROM journal has been truncated....

journal = DELTA BETWEEN THE LAST CHECKPOINT AND CURRENT DATE

How to Restore Helix Core server?
====================================
== OLD ====p4d -r $P4ROOT -jr checkpoint_file
== OLD ====p4d -r /opt/perforce/servers/master -jr checkpoint.1
sudo -u perforce p4dctl stop master
sudo -u perforce p4d -r /opt/perforce/servers/master -jr checkpoint.1
sudo -u perforce p4dctl start master

Establish trust relationship with SSL-enabled server...
The fingerprint of the server of your P4PORT setting
'ssl:1666' (127.0.0.1:1666) is not known.
That fingerprint is E0:3A:D0:2E:1D:11:E0:05:E0:74:49:60:ED:9D:9D:FC:2A:5C:EE:01
Added trust for P4PORT 'ssl:1666' (127.0.0.1:1666)
Creating super-user account...
User super not changed.
Server ID: master
Initializing protections table...
Protections saved.
Setting security level to 3 (high)...
Counter security set.
Setting password...
Creating ticket for root user


::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
::
::  P4D configuration has completed successfully.
::
::  Here is what has been done so far:
::
::  - Your p4d service settings have been written to
::    the following p4dctl configuration file:
::      /etc/perforce/p4dctl.conf.d/master.conf
::  - The p4d service has been initialized with the P4ROOT:
::      /opt/perforce/servers/master
::  - The p4d service has been started with the P4PORT: ssl:1666
::  - The p4d service has been set to Security Level 3.
::  - The new Perforce super-user 'super' has been created and the
::    password has been set to the one specified.
::
::  Here is what you can do now:
::
::  - You can manage it with the 'perforce' user, using the following:
::
::      sudo -u perforce p4dctl <cmd>
::
::  - You can connect to it by setting the P4PORT and P4USER
::    environment variables and running 'p4 <cmd>'. For example, run:
::
::      export P4PORT=ssl:1666
::      export P4USER=super
::
::      p4 login
::
::    For help, run:
::
::      p4 help
::
::  - To connect to this p4d service from another machine, include
::    this machine's name or IP address in the P4PORT. For example:
::
::      export P4PORT=ssl:172.31.27.216:1666
::
::  - For help with creating Perforce Helix user accounts, populating
::    the depot with files, and making other customizations for your
::    site, see the Helix Versioning Engine Administrator Guide:
