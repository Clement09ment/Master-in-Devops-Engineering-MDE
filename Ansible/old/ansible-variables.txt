EXAMPLE
- hosts: all
  vars:
    hello: world
  tasks:
  - name: Ansible Basic Variable Example
    debug:
      msg: "{{ hello }}"

- hosts: all
  vars:
    hello:
      - World
      - Asia
      - South America
      - North America
      - Artic
      - Antartic
      - Oceania
      - Europe
      - Africa
  tasks:
  - name: Ansible List variable Example
    debug:
      msg: "{{ hello[2] }}"

- hosts: all
vars:
  hello: [Asia, Americas, Artic, Antartic ,Oceania,Europe,Africa]
  tasks:
  - name: Ansible List variable Example
    debug:
      msg: "{{ hello[2] }}"


- hosts: all
  vars:
    hello: [Asia, Americas, Artic, Antartic ,Oceania,Europe,Africa]
  tasks:
  - name: Ansible array variables example
    debug: 
      msg: "{{ item }}"
    with_items:
      - "{{ hello }}"

- hosts: all
  vars:
    python:
      Designer: 'Guido van Rosum'
      Developer: 'Python Software Foundation'
      OS: 'Cross-platform'
  tasks:
  - name: Ansible Dictionary Example
    debug:
      msg: "{{ python }}"



Here is the order of precedence from least to greatest (the last listed variables winning prioritization):
===============================================
role defaults [1]
inventory file or script group vars [2]
inventory group_vars/all [3]
playbook group_vars/all [3]
inventory group_vars/* [3]
playbook group_vars/* [3]
inventory file or script host vars [2]
inventory host_vars/*
playbook host_vars/*
host facts / cached set_facts [4]
inventory host_vars/* [3]
playbook host_vars/* [3]
host facts
play vars
play vars_prompt
play vars_files
role vars (defined in role/vars/main.yml)
block vars (only for tasks in block)
task vars (only for the task)
include_vars
set_facts / registered vars
role (and include_role) params
include params
extra vars (always win precedence)


Footnotes

[1]	Tasks in each role will see their own role’s defaults. Tasks defined outside of a role will see the last role’s defaults.
[2]	(1, 2) Variables defined in inventory file or provided by dynamic inventory.
[3]	(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6) Includes vars added by ‘vars plugins’ as well as host_vars and group_vars which are added by the default vars plugin shipped with Ansible.
[4]	When created with set_facts’s cacheable option, variables will have the high precedence in the play, but will be the same as a host facts precedence when they come from the cache.
