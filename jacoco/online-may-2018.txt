START OF THE PROJECT (Where is the Jacoco firtting on SDLC)
============================
PLAN -> CODE -> ANALYSIS -> BUILD -> UT -> PACK -> Dep2Repo -> Dep2QA -> AT -> CodeCoverge
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
JIRA -> GIT -> SONARQUBE -> MAVEN -> JUNUT -> JAR -> NEXUS --> PUPPET -> SELENIUM --> Jaococo

What is Jacoco?
	Code Coverage tool

What is Code Coverage?
	is a process to know automatcially what is % of the Code has been tested.
						======
	LINE IS COVERED OR NOT?
	METHOD IS COVERED OR NOT?
	BLOCK IS COVERED OR NOT?
	CLASS COVERED OR NOT?
	-----------------------
	PACKAGE is COVERED OR NOT

file1.java(5method + 100 lines) ->  file1.class -> file1.jar -->  JVM
	How many method? How many lines has been covered? ====%

Benefit
	A TEST TEAM -> Write a Test Code --> Covering the required % of the code or not????
	DEV TEAM -- Juunit ----Covering the required % of the code or not????
	RELEASE - OVERALL TESTING is done one all the code or not??
	CLIENT - Testing team + Dev Team + release team


CODE COVERAGE IS NOT FUNCTIONAL TEST COVERAGE
=============================================

What is other tools available?
	JACOCO	 - JAVA 
	Cobertura - JAVA
	Emma - JAVA
	NCOVER - DOTNET


How Sonarqube integrate with CodeCoverage?
	SonarQube automatically integration with
			JACOCO
			Cobertura


How it works?
	using Jacoco Agent....

	JACOCO is reading your JVM and reading the Loaded file for the 
		package/class/method and capture into .exec.

Diff beween JACOCO and COBERUTRA
=========================================
COBERTURA NEEDS INSTRUMENTATION OFFLINE
				=======
JACOCO CAN INSTRUMENT DYNAMICALLY

APP.JAR(CLASSES) --> BYTE INSTRUMENTATIONS --> JVM --> COBERTURA (.ser)
JACOCO - I it can instrument dynamcitally the moment you say you want to cover only for APP.JAR


What is the process of Code Coverage?
	INSTRUCMENT a binary(not needed iN jacoco)
		loAD IN jvm
			RUN THE TEST CASES
				GET A DATAFILE .EXEC(jACOCO) .SER cOBERTURA
					cONVERT THAT DATA FILE INTO html REPORT......
		

What is Diff between Code Coverage & Test Coverage???
-----------------------------------------------------
app.JAR (100 classs) -- 100(tEST FIle)				CODE COVERAGE	TEST Coverage		
app.jar		     -- 50 test case cover 50 class		50%		50%
app.jar 	        30 test cases which wil 80 class	80%		30%

CODE COVERAGE ---% of the Code has been covereed
TEST COVERAGE ---% of the test cases has been run


How to install it?
	Manual ---> jacoco.jar --JVM(APP SERVER (JBOSS, TOMCAT, WL, WS)
	Maven--> pom.xml , include a jacoco plugins...
			mvn verify
	Ant -- build.xmls



How to configure it?
https://github.com/scmgalaxy/jacoco-maven-unittestv2

mvn verify
	compile
	unit test
	package
	integ test
	verify
