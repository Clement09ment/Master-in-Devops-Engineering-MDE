How Teamcity Agent and Teamcity Server Data Transfers with each other?

- Unidirectional Agent-to-Server Communication
A TeamCity agent connects to the TeamCity server via the URL configured as the serverUrl agent property. This is called unidirectional agent-to-server connection. Agents use unidirectional agent-to-server connection via the polling protocol: the agent establishes an HTTP(S) connection to the TeamCity Server, and polls the server periodically for server commands. 

-Bidirectional Agent-to-Server Communication
If specifically configured, TeamCity agent can use legacy bidirectional communication which also requires establishing a connection from the server to the agents. The bidirectional communication is a legacy connection between the agent and the server and it needs to be specifically enabled

To view whether the agent-server communication is unidirectional or bidirectional for a particular agent, navigate to Agents | <Agent Name> | Agent Summary tab, the Details section, Communication Protocol.
