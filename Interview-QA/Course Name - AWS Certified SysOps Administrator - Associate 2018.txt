3. You have a web application which is using AutoScaling and Elastic Load Balancing. You want to monitor the application to make sure that it maintains a good customer experience which is defined by how long it takes to load the application for the end user in their browser.

4. As your web application has increased in popularity, reports of performance issues have grown. The current configuration initiates scaling actions based on Average CPU utilization; however during reports of slowness, CloudWatch graphs have shown that average CPU utilization remains steady at 30%. This is well below the alarm threshold of 55%. Your developers have discovered that performance degradation occurs on an instance when it is processing more than 300 threads and that this is due to the special way the application is programmed. What is the best way to ensure that your application scales to match demand?

3. You have a stateless web application on a m4.10xlarge EC2 instance. Your application is both memory and CPU intensive and is not performing well when under heavy load. Users are reporting long delays in the application's performance. The application itself maintains its state in DynamoDB. The DynamoDB table is properly provisioned and responses are returning really fast. What option below will best resolve this issue?
a. There is obviously an issue with the memory/CPU load. Provision another m4.10xlarge EC2 instance and place both EC2 instances behind an Elastic Load Balancer to help even the load.
